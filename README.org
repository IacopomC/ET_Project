#+TITLE: Eye tracking project: Implementation, comparison and analysis of the I-VT and I-DT gaze detection algorithms
#+CREATOR: Emmanuel Bustos T.
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* Description
  This project consists in the implementation analysis and comparison of two gaze detection eye tracking algorithms, one velocity based (I-VT) and the other dispersion based (I-DT). The development of this project was done in the Python programming language on a Google Colab notebook, where all the sections to achieve the desired results are explained in detail.

  The notebook in question can be checked [[https://github.com/ema2159/ET_Project/blob/main/ET_project.ipynb][here]].
